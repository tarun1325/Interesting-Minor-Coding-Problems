Program		:		write a program , given a matrix with 0’s and 1’s , you enter the matrix at (0,0) in left to right direction , whenever you 						encounter a 0 you retain in same direction , if you encounter a 1’s you have to change direction to right of current direction 					and change that 1 value to 0, you have to find out from which index you will leave the matrix at the end.
Example		:		Input
					6 8
					0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
					0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
					0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
					0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
					0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0
					0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0

					Output
					row : 6, col : 7

Awesome Mistake	:
Find out what is the Value of 'dir' after execution of this code snippet ?

int dir = 1;
switch( dir )
{
	case 1:	dir = 2;						
			break;
	case 2:	dir = 3;						
			break;
	case 3:	dir = 4 ;						
			break;
	case 4:	dir = 1;						
			break;
}
